Iteration: iter-233 (`frontend-uiux-law-admission` — the owner's
2026-09-25 tmpfiles hand-off of the external *CanonSim Workbench —
Ultimate Frontend / UI / UX / Visual Architecture* consolidated pack
+ the «проанализировать... и начать работать в этом направлении»
direction call): docs/FRONTEND_UIUX_LAW.md ADMITTED as the frontend
interaction-architecture law owner (D-214 — the D-024/D-200
distillation law: the original stays with the owner, never vendored):
the executive doctrine (the UX invariant QUESTION→…→NEXT
DISCRIMINATOR; the implementation invariant; the missing-middle-layer
diagnosis — the analytical interaction grammar between the semantic
contract and the visual system) + the law chain (the spec-integrity
law) + the IA (WORK/RESOURCES/SYSTEM; SURFACE=intent, VIEW=
representation) + the workspace grammar (CONTEXT/QUERY/PRIMARY VIEW/
INSPECTOR/EVIDENCE) + the selection model + focus/context + semantic
zoom + compare + timeline + graph policy + the evidence ladder + the
epistemic grammar (the state set + AUTHORITY×CLAIM orthogonality) +
the query lifecycle + empty semantics + drill-down + the Evidence
Capsule + T1–T8 + the cost budgets + the accessibility/reduced-
motion/focus-keyboard/responsive/DPI/localization contracts + the
component law (shell split by responsibility) + Scene IR integration +
bounded rendering + surface hygiene + the verification matrix (static
≠runtime≠task; the A–I gates; the evidence classification) + the
anti-patterns + the agent rules + the P0–P4 order + the
contradictions register + the 20 invariants. VISUAL_SYSTEM_UI §11 the
companion-requirements routing (the drift the pack diagnosed —
accessibility/keyboard/reduced-motion/responsive/localization were
materially missing from the short law; §10 re-pointed: ux-1 + obs-1
BEFORE indefinite peripheral polish). TASKS: ux-1 (the P0 minimums)
+ obs-1..N (the Observatory slice family) registered. Routing: NAV
§1/§2/§3.
Phase: 6 (Packs & worldbuilder) — CLOSED (gate PASS iter-116, D-151;
the ladder complete 0..6 — the standing work: the owner-gated backlog
(the wb family its live head + the ux/obs families per FRONTEND_UIUX_
LAW §25) + the world track + the SoW horizon, ROADMAP §2/§6) ·
2285 passed + 6 skipped, ruff clean, docguard clean (doc-only, zero
code change — Python 3.12.14, the env pin; the 5 REDOT_EXE-gated
visual packets + duckdb skipping clean per D6/D-093) ·
Date: 2026-09-25 ·
Scope: docs/FRONTEND_UIUX_LAW.md (the admission) + docs/VISUAL_
SYSTEM_UI.md (§11 + the §10 re-point) + docs/TASKS.md (the ux-1 +
obs-1 rows + the ledger) + docs/AGENT_NAVIGATION.md (§1/§2/§3 + the
theme@0.4 courtesy re-pin) + scripts/docguard.py (the allowlist entry
— 627 lines after three cruft rounds, the enum/invariant lists the
substance) + the state docs (STATUS/TASKS/worklog/DECISIONS) — 8
paths (doc-only; an admission's routing surface, the iter-225/229
precedent).
Track A: the wb family (iter-232 the race/latch fixes + the OLED
re-pin; the ux-1/obs-1 families now the queue head per FRONTEND_UIUX_
LAW §25, wb-13+ the P2 visual continuation; the prior record:
iter-231 CI-unred + NavButton, 230 wb-12, 229 the visual law, 228
wb-11 transport chain, 227 wb-10, 226 wb-9 D-208, 225 the engine
index D-207, 224 D-206, 223 wb-8, 222 wb-7, 221 wb-6, 220 wb-5, 219
wb-4, 218 wb-3, 216/215 wb-1). The detail lives in the worklog + git.

## Invariants (one line each — full rules in AGENTS.md §4)

- INV-1 Event sourcing: state changes only via events; the JSONL log is the
  append-only truth; SQLite is a rebuildable index; the log writer is the
  only canon-write path (D-031).
- INV-2 Determinism: single point of randomness control — one master seed;
  named streams derived via the RngBank (`stable_hash` = sha256-based);
  no wall-clock; `sorted()` iteration; fixed `PYTHONHASHSEED`; queue key
  `(tick, sub_order, actor_id)`; cosmetic draws never desync canon replay
  (D-028 — AGENTS.md §4 is the single reading owner).
- INV-3 Content/code split: no domain words in engine code (`core/` +
  `sim/` + `brief/` — the mediator circuit joined the stoplist at
  iter-10a); all setting data in `content/tavern_pack/`; the periphery
  dirs (`render/`, `cli/`, `scripts/`) carry pack paths/help text/prose
  by design (D-046).
- INV-4 LLM boundary — the sanctioned surfaces: the network surface is
  EXACTLY THREE modules — `cli/engine.py` (outbound engine wire, D-193),
  `workbench/api/transport.py` (inbound loopback gateway, D-201), and
  `workbench/platform/model_fetch.py` (outbound model-assets fetch, D-208);
  everything else stays network-free and engine-agnostic — AGENTS §4
  the law owner, the architecture test the executable.
- INV-5 Log immutability: committed logs are never edited; corrections are
  new events.

## FAQ / Pitfalls

> One-liners + the owner link (NAV §3's duplication rule); the essays
> restated their named owners (doc-3). The operational recipes live in
> TECH_NOTES §14 (live-session) + §15 (corpus-regen).

- **Read-side folds (echo/traits) never feed entropy/channel inputs (L6/EPIST-1, iter-46/55); the intent door is the only legal path** — DIRECTOR_SPEC §4; the one legal render: BRIEF_SPEC §3.5.
- **Every visual/UI row routes through docs/VISUAL_SYSTEM_UI.md FIRST (the surface-driven grammar, the token taxonomy, the state matrix, the §8 report; mechanisms not looks; the app spec's §18 evidence law wins over quiet chrome) + its §11 companion routing (accessibility/keyboard/reduced-motion/responsive/localization — binding on every visual row, never silently dropped) — VISUAL_SYSTEM_UI §0/§6/§11 (admitted iter-229, D-211); every frontend INTERACTION/IA/selection/epistemic/accessibility/localization/responsive/Observatory question routes through docs/FRONTEND_UIUX_LAW.md FIRST (the interaction law owner, admitted iter-233, D-214); engine/API questions still route through docs/REDOT_ENGINE_INDEX.md (D-207).**
- **Chronicle conditionals read FLAT context keys; a checked action's verdict is NESTED (`outcome.check.passed`, iter-43) — `render/tracery.py`; validator verdicts follow CURRENT canon never the anchor (iter-9; invented = contradicted, unmodeled = insufficient_data) — VALIDATION_SPEC §4–§5.**
- **Crossings fire in tick order (co-occurring: the coarsest clock first — macro → rotation → beat); director/urgencies ride the INTENT door, reactions the COMMIT door (D-037/38/39)** — BRIEF_SPEC §3.2/§3.3; KI#17 (git).
- **System passes scan the whole projection, never the seeding events (KI#16); the decay baseline = the last axis-changing event's tick via the (entity, prop) → tick index (KI#19, D-050)** — D-050's record.
- **Hardcoded `from_` is a desync (KI#13/KI#46): repeat effects idempotent; the carried-item position contract single-owned by `movement_changes`; the `_commit` gate fails loud before the write (D-035)** — `core/resolvers.py`.
- **INV-3's stoplist: no setting nouns in the ENGINE (`core/`+`sim/`+`brief/`, segment-matched, pack-tied word list); `render/`/`cli/`/`scripts/` are periphery (D-046)** — the stoplist test owns enforcement.
- **Malformed playscript steps raise RunnerError; well-formed but world-impossible intents emit `intent_rejected` (attempts are facts); urgency rejections stay silent** — PARSER_SPEC §4/§6.
- **Env-pinned verification cuts both ways: the golden T1 fixture byte-compares only on the generating interpreter (TEST_PLAN §1.1, §3 the migration); and PIPE-READING subprocess tests never lean on the host's PYTHONUNBUFFERED — the sandbox exports it, CI/owner machines do not (KI#93: three green-local/red-CI iterations) — the chain owns its buffering (`-u` child, line-buffered supervisor, the env-stripping spawn)** — tests/test_workbench_launch.py + TEST_PLAN §1.1
- **Doc drift is evidence, not prescription — verify with `git log -S` AND the pinning test before acting (KI#42/48/51/80); bootstrap texts are convenience copies, never a second source** — D-024/D-027.
- **The code-quality bar: AGENTS §4/§9 the law, BLUEPRINT §2 (L13/L14) the constitution, test_architecture + the stoplist test the executable; no new canonical layers (D-018)** — D-031.
- **Procedural guards: git hygiene (verify `.gitignore` after any upload; a file DELETION needs an explicit `git rm` or it never lands (KI#55); `git status --short` before every commit — AGENTS §7) + scope-creep (content/tone → D-030 + PACK_SPEC's sketch row; two consecutive doc-only iterations stop unless a fresh owner request fires (D-022) — AGENTS §2)**
- **DF exports are malformed/truncated CP437 XML: byte-sanitize, stream with iterparse + clear, tail-check truncation; off-matrix record tags render UNDOCUMENTED** — the matrix: `docs/ref/df_legends_xml.md`; the recipe: TECH_NOTES §3.1–§3.3.
- **The cap laws: substance over line count — filler cut always; named systems/field lists/enum values/verdicts never cut to fit; a breach triggers a cruft pass first** — AGENTS §6/§6.1; enforced by `scripts/docguard.py`.
- **The read-side layers are pure: render rebuilds the RngBank from the header seed; the assembler zero-RNG over (log, ledger) (D-049); retrieval a pure fold, `knower` IS known_by (D-088); and the scene ledger: commit → retire_contradicted → sync_scene → assemble → narrator → apply_delta (auto-syncs; re-asserting terminal states = laundering, refused); the ledger dies with its session (D-139)** — BRIEF_SPEC §2/§3.3.
- **The STATUS tests-count line feeds the digest's regex: `N passed + M skipped, ruff clean` — one line, comma-free from the counts to `ruff clean` (parenthetical caveats go AFTER `docguard clean`), else the digest reads `(unparsed)`** — `scripts/digest.py` `_TESTS_RE`.
- **The Workbench runtime layout + the local model flow (wb-9/D-208 + wb-10): `workbench/runtime/` is the gitignored root — `models/` (the MODELS_ASSETS folder, auto-created), `llama.cpp/` (the drop folder; the launcher discovers llama-server.exe at its root or one folder deep, then PATH), `settings.json` (the persisted launch settings — corrupt/foreign-schema refuses loud), `launcher.json` (the launcher's own persisted Redot pick); the zero-command entry is `Workbench.bat` at the repo ROOT (double-click; the Redot FOLDER resolves its engine exe — the persisted pick, then REDOT_EXE, then the Desktop-shaped auto-scan, then the native folder picker once; `Workbench Setup.bat` re-picks; `scripts/workbench_launch.py` the same chain for the command form — run it from the repo ROOT, inside scripts/ the path doubles); a model ARRIVES by the native picker — the OS file/folder dialog hands ABSOLUTE paths to the gateway's `model.import` run (a local copy: `.part` + atomic rename, live progress, cooperative cancel — NO network, INV-4 untouched; the URL fetch stays the collapsed advanced row); `model.list`'s document carries `models_root` (the open-folder answer, never a local guess); `scripts/workbench_app.py` alone serves the gateway with MANAGED the default** — the modules' own docstrings + CONTRACTS §5's wb-10 note
- **The iter-232 laws: a cooperative-cancellation TEST never calls checkpoint() once and prays — the single call races the main thread's run.cancel dispatch (a fast runner's worker passes through, the "unreachable" guard closes the run FAILED; the sandbox stays green on scheduling luck while CI goes red — KI#95, three-form verified: sandbox, forced fast worker, delayed cancel); poll the checkpoint (the work contract's own lock-free observation surface — run.cancel is never starved) bounded until the cancellation lands, an absent cancel fails LOUDLY; discovery lists never freeze behind one-shot success latches — every surface entry re-scans (KI#96: the owner's hand-dropped GGUF must appear on the next Models entry; the wb-11 re-arm lesson generalizes from FAILURE to staleness — a "requested once" flag guarding the happy path is the bug, not the guard); and a theme re-pin is VALUES-ONLY — every token name, size and pin survives the palette swap (theme@0.4/D-213: the owner's OLED call over the external brief's "never pure black" doctrine — the neutral near-black ramp + the ONE teal accent, 21 WCAG contrast pairs measured)** — tests/test_model_fetch.py `_SlowFetcher.fetch` + shell.gd `_refresh_models` + test_shell_contract.py (the latch ban + the base/accent pins), iter-232
- **GDScript has NO implicit string-literal concatenation — two adjacent literals across lines are a Python-ism that refuses the whole file at parse (KI#91, iter-224's five sites); one literal per line; and any Redot/Godot engine question routes FIRST through `docs/REDOT_ENGINE_INDEX.md` (Redot 26.2 LTS pinned, Godot docs secondary cross-reference only; Redot 26.2 has NO `HTTPServer` — the app gateway stays Python-side; route to the smallest section, never read whole)** — test_shell_contract.py's adjacent-literal ban + the index §0/§21, D-207
- **The chat follow law (iter-230): read the scrollbar's max AFTER a frame — the autowrapped labels size late, reading it at call_deferred time is the short-scroll bug; TWEEN the bar's float `value` (never the int `scroll_vertical` jump); gate on near-bottom (SCROLL_FOLLOW_SLOP_PX) so a reader deep in history is never yanked; the late-layout re-settle stays bounded to ONE pass** — shell.gd `_scroll_to_bottom_smooth` (the owner's «не происходит плавной прокрутки вниз» call, the LM Studio/Discord follow mechanism)

## Next step

**iter-233 DONE: docs/FRONTEND_UIUX_LAW.md ADMITTED (D-214 — the
owner's Ultimate Frontend/UI/UX/Visual Architecture pack, the tmpfiles
hand-off + «начать работать в этом направлении»; the interaction law:
the doctrine, the workspace/selection/epistemic grammars, the
accessibility/localization/responsive contracts, the verification
matrix, the P0–P4 order) + VISUAL_SYSTEM_UI §11 the companion routing
(the spec-integrity drift repair) + the ux-1/obs-1 rows registered —
LANDED (doc-only; the queue re-pointed per the law's §25).**

1. ux-1 per FRONTEND_UIUX_LAW §25's P0 (the minimums row: the _tr
   localization boundary + the reduced-motion setting + the
   viewport/min-size policy + the focus/keyboard baseline — TASKS'
   ux-1 row) then obs-1 the Observatory vertical slice (P1 — the
   interaction grammar validated BEFORE full analytical backend
   coverage; the wb-13+ visual rows the P2 continuation per
   VISUAL_SYSTEM_UI §10) — each row opens on the owner's call
   (the direction call already given for the family's order).
   The exported-Windows-build row (the owner's «по человечески
   сделать это нельзя?» — Workbench.bat's dev form is the editor
   binary running the project; the product form is an exported
   .exe over export presets, a row of its own) parked per AGENTS
   §2.4 — a named row when the owner calls it.
2. The remaining station rows (the owner's next engine run,
   TEST_PLAN §8.5's standing gaps + the wb-6 arm: the live-build
   /models/load + /models/unload re-verification against the
   b11064 station's ROUTER reality): the 27B GBNF parse arm + the
   one-model-constrained A/B (CONTRACTS §4.3 arm a) + the brief/
   parse component split; the narrator-convention call for live
   narrate play is two-sided now — more live beats at Q9B (size
   the tail) or the 27B as the one-model candidate (the §1 sweet
   spot, both doors) — the owner's choice (round 5's 12B + round
   6's 9B data: §13.1; bg-9's mapping-drift datum rides the same
   decision).
2. The standing frames: the embodiment options (the older units'
   rows — the step's notch record/hatch, the kin's own — each a
   future row's own call), the debt-1 residues (the crossing's
   own standing state the charcoalpaper precedent's sibling — the
   punt's purchase and the flood paper's fall still authored, each
   a future row's own call), the re-weigh's SALE (the heap's bloom
   drain — the withhold's own future row), the shave's temporal
   placement (the arc's assembly's remaining half — a future row's
   own call), the SoW horizon (bg-6, owner-deferred — long-parked
   per the owner's 2026-09-21 call). New rows enter on the
   owner's call only.
3. The intake-34/35/36/38 residues (each behind its own trigger,
   never a default): the ref-file deep record — a named row
   consuming a specific math-catalog or guide29 mechanism family
   (the per-card pass done at intake-35, the families re-confirmed
   at HEAD; Experiment 0's verdict + R1's landing close the other
   two residues — phases.md §6); the road-traffic depth-7 rider's
   evaluation grammar now carries intake-36's P01+P03 consult
   (capacity ≠ existence, the edge-perturbation discriminant, the
   fracture regime-change test — phases.md §6's intake-36 block);
   the intake-38 candidates (held-out transfer behind engine-1's
   corpus arms; the contract fields stopping-rule/spillover/
   nuisance behind the first claim packet that needs them —
   phases.md §6's intake-38 block, each behind its named first
   consumer, never a default).
