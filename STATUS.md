Iteration: iter-201 (`iter-201-agency` — the owner's
queue-order call «agency → withhold → the heartbreak probe», the
agency row first — the W5 covering residue's first measured
successor): the shave's AGENCY row landed — the bloom kind's gloss
re-authored to carry the direction of action ("bloom kept off the
weighbeam since the guild factor shaved the camp's weight" — the
spine's own committed words; the iter-199 re-run's measured gap: the
glosses carried the temporal tie "since the shave", never WHO shaved
whom, reading 2 INVERTING the direction — the camp read as the
accused) — the mechanism unchanged (rs-2's mapping, rs-3's row,
zero code, zero corpus price), the pins updated as the deliberate
act; the probe's re-run MANDATORY BAR MET (glm n=2 convergent: the
guild the shaver, the camp the shaved, the inversion GONE, the
withhold read as the camp's answer "as a protest" / "a symbol of
his defiance"; the honest residues: the shave's temporal placement
never assembled + the withhold's one-surface contradiction the
queue's next — TASKS rs-5 + WORLD_TESTS §9's W5 entry).
Phase: 6 (Packs & worldbuilder) — CLOSED (gate PASS iter-116, D-151;
the ladder complete 0..6 — the standing work: the owner-gated backlog
+ the world track + the SoW horizon, ROADMAP §2/§6) ·
2034 passed + 1 skipped, ruff clean, docguard clean (Python 3.12.14,
the env pin; verified at BASE_COMMIT 384758a — 2034+1 green, ruff
clean, docguard clean, before the change) ·

Scope: content/province_pack/templates.json + tests/test_accountgloss.py
+ tests/test_flowgloss.py + tests/test_freightvol.py +
docs/worldbuild/WORLD_TESTS.md + docs/TASKS.md + STATUS.md +
worklog.md — 8 paths (the rs-landing class: the pack row + the pins
+ the claim record + the state docs).
Track A: the reader-surface boundary's own closure (the rs family's
fifth member, pack data + pins only, zero runtime change, the goldens
byte-untouched); the world track separate (D-186, never a second
queue). The prior iterations' record: iter-200 (renamelint), iter-199
(flowgloss). The detail lives in the worklog + git.


## Invariants (one line each — full rules in AGENTS.md §4)

- INV-1 Event sourcing: state changes only via events; the JSONL log is the
  append-only truth; SQLite is a rebuildable index; the log writer is the
  only canon-write path (D-031).
- INV-2 Determinism: single point of randomness control — one master seed;
  named streams derived via the RngBank (`stable_hash` = sha256-based);
  no wall-clock; `sorted()` iteration; fixed `PYTHONHASHSEED`; queue key
  `(tick, sub_order, actor_id)`; cosmetic draws never desync canon replay
  (D-028 — AGENTS.md §4 is the single reading owner).
- INV-3 Content/code split: no domain words in engine code (`core/` +
  `sim/` + `brief/` — the mediator circuit joined the stoplist at
  iter-10a); all setting data in `content/tavern_pack/`; the periphery
  dirs (`render/`, `cli/`, `scripts/`) carry pack paths/help text/prose
  by design (D-046).
- INV-4 LLM boundary — the explicit adapter: the network surface is
  EXACTLY ONE module, `cli/engine.py` (engine-1's landing, D-193);
  everything else stays network-free and engine-agnostic — AGENTS §4
  the law owner, the architecture test the executable.
- INV-5 Log immutability: committed logs are never edited; corrections are
  new events.

- **Read-side folds (echo/traits) never feed entropy/channel inputs (L6/EPIST-1, iter-46/55); the intent door is the only legal path** — DIRECTOR_SPEC §4; the one legal render: BRIEF_SPEC §3.5.
- **Chronicle conditionals read FLAT context keys; a checked action's verdict is NESTED (`outcome.check.passed`) — the branch EVENT TYPE is the carrier (iter-43)** — `render/tracery.py`.
- **Validator verdicts follow CURRENT canon, never the anchor (iter-9); invented = contradicted, unmodeled = insufficient_data** — VALIDATION_SPEC §4–§5; the call budget §7.
- **Crossings fire in tick order (co-occurring: the coarsest clock first — macro → rotation → beat); director/urgencies ride the INTENT door, reactions the COMMIT door (D-037/38/39)** — BRIEF_SPEC §3.2/§3.3; KI#17 (git).
- **System passes scan the whole projection, never the seeding events (KI#16); the decay baseline = the last axis-changing event's tick via the (entity, prop) → tick index (KI#19, D-050)** — D-050's record.
- **Hardcoded `from_` is a desync (KI#13/KI#46): repeat effects idempotent; the carried-item position contract single-owned by `movement_changes`; the `_commit` gate fails loud before the write (D-035)** — `core/resolvers.py`.
- **INV-3's stoplist: no setting nouns in the ENGINE (`core/`+`sim/`+`brief/`, segment-matched, pack-tied word list); `render/`/`cli/`/`scripts/` are periphery (D-046)** — the stoplist test owns enforcement.
- **Malformed playscript steps raise RunnerError; well-formed but world-impossible intents emit `intent_rejected` (attempts are facts); urgency rejections stay silent** — PARSER_SPEC §4/§6.
- **The golden T1 fixture is env-pinned: byte-compare only on the generating interpreter; the regen guard pins schema_version + a fresh byte-diff** — TEST_PLAN §1.1 (§3 the migration).
- **Doc drift is evidence, not prescription — verify with `git log -S` AND the pinning test before acting (KI#42/48/51/80); bootstrap texts are convenience copies, never a second source** — D-024/D-027.
- **The code-quality bar: AGENTS §4/§9 the law, BLUEPRINT §2 (L13/L14) the constitution, test_architecture + the stoplist test the executable; no new canonical layers (D-018)** — D-031.
- **Git hygiene: verify `.gitignore` after any upload; a file DELETION needs an explicit `git rm` in the report block or it never lands (KI#55); `git status --short` before every commit** — AGENTS §7.
- **Scope-creep guards: content/tone → D-030 + PACK_SPEC's sketch row; two consecutive doc-only iterations stop unless a fresh owner request fires (D-022)** — AGENTS §2.
- **DF exports are malformed/truncated CP437 XML: byte-sanitize, stream with iterparse + clear, tail-check truncation; off-matrix record tags render UNDOCUMENTED** — the matrix: `docs/ref/df_legends_xml.md`; the recipe: TECH_NOTES §3.1–§3.3.
- **The cap laws: substance over line count — filler cut always; named systems/field lists/enum values/verdicts never cut to fit; a breach triggers a cruft pass first** — AGENTS §6/§6.1; enforced by `scripts/docguard.py`.
- **The read-side layers are pure: render rebuilds the RngBank from the header seed; the assembler zero-RNG over (log, ledger) (D-049); retrieval a pure fold, `knower` IS known_by (D-088)** — BRIEF_SPEC §2/§3.3.
- **The scene ledger: commit → retire_contradicted → sync_scene → assemble → narrator → apply_delta (auto-syncs; re-asserting terminal states = laundering, refused); the ledger dies with its session (D-139)** — BRIEF_SPEC §3.3.
- **Gate mechanics: seed 125, only the director flag changes — ON fires `director_0000`, OFF ≥3 emergent chains (baseline 24); M3 counts per endpoint, decay-dominated in magnitude** — TEST_PLAN §4 + the D-136 verdict row.

## Next step

**iter-201 DONE: the shave's AGENCY row (the owner's queue-order
call «agency → withhold → the heartbreak probe» — rs-5, the bloom
kind's gloss re-authored to carry the direction of action, the
mechanism unchanged, the pins updated; the probe's re-run mandatory
bar MET, glm n=2 convergent — the inversion GONE, the withhold read
as the camp's answer).**

1. The withhold's one-surface contradiction (the queue's next row,
  the owner's order): the heap's meaning + the fund's climb + the
  beam's law never joined as the camp's ANSWER to the tilted beam —
  the withhold's own joke's material.
2. The heartbreak probe (the W5 trio's remaining station, its design
   material carrying intake-36's C03+F02 consult — WORLD_WORKPLAN
   §7's decision points).
3. The human live-band re-run after several reader-side fixes (the
   LLM reader the instrument so far, glm n=2 — the owner's option
   (б); items 1–2 above the reader-side fixes it waits on).
4. The remaining station rows (the owner's next engine run, TEST_PLAN
   §8.5's standing gaps): the 27B GBNF parse arm + the
   one-model-constrained A/B (CONTRACTS §4.3 arm a) + the brief/parse
   component split; the narrator-convention call for live narrate
   play is two-sided now — more live beats at Q9B (size the tail) or
   the 27B as the one-model candidate (the §1 sweet spot, both
   doors) — the owner's choice (round 5's 12B + round 6's 9B data:
   §13.1; bg-9's mapping-drift datum rides the same decision).
5. The standing frames: the embodiment options (the older units' rows
   — the step's notch record/hatch, the kin's own — each a future
   row's own call), the debt-1 residues (the crossing's own standing
   state the charcoalpaper precedent's sibling — the punt's purchase
   and the flood paper's fall still authored, each a future row's own
   call), the re-weigh's SALE (the heap's bloom drain —
   the withhold's own future row), the SoW horizon (bg-6, owner-deferred —
   long-parked per the owner's 2026-09-21 call). New rows enter on the
   owner's call only.
6. The intake-34/35/36 residues (each behind its own trigger, never a
   default): the ref-file deep record — a named row consuming a
   specific math-catalog or guide29 mechanism family (the per-card
   pass done at intake-35, the families re-confirmed at HEAD;
   Experiment 0's verdict + R1's landing close the other two
   residues — phases.md §6); the road-traffic depth-7 rider's
   evaluation grammar now carries intake-36's P01+P03 consult
   (capacity ≠ existence, the edge-perturbation discriminant, the
   fracture regime-change test — phases.md §6's intake-36 block).
